\section{Introduction: Reddit, gamers, and social networks}
Gaming is an omnipresent artistic medium enjoyed by a plurality of Americans. Research from the \textit{Entertainment Software Association} (E.S.A.) has found that about 65\% of American adults play video games. About 46\% of said gamers are female.\cite{esagamers} The E.S.A.'s research counters the tired trope of gamers as young, immature boys. Despite the prevalence and diversity of gamers academia is woefully behind on ludology, the study of gaming. Gaming lacks the prestige of other artistic entertainment media such as books, music, and film. An interested party may find texts on the innovations of Allen Ginsberg's poem \textit{Howl} or Sonic Youth's \textit{Daydream Nation} while scarcely finding an academic article on the contributions of the video game \textit{Doom}. 

Ludology is as exciting as fields such as A.I. despite lacking the selfsame effervescence. In other words, ludology may be studied from many different angles. Political sociologists would find much to mine from the philosophical schisms in the gaming community. Recent grassroots movements to push for more representation in video games spawned a revanchist and sexist counter movement. Besides the political, sociologists may write ethnographies of the online communities or interactions that occur within gaming. Mark Chen's \textit{Leet Noob: The Life and Death of an Expert Player Group in 'World of Warcraft'} is a study of a group of gamers who tackle dungeons in \textit{World of Warcraft}. Chen writes from the perspective of both a gamer and a social scientist to apply theories such as social and cultural capital, actor-network theory, social construction, et cetera to the video game.\cite{chenwow}. The list above is clearly not exhaustive. However, I'd like to mention, as an aside, that online communities are transient; ignoring ludology risks permanently missing out on an aspect of culture.

My thesis focusses on the intersection between network science via the social network Reddit and video games. My goal is to contribute to both ludology as well as studies of Reddit. Gaming by virtue is a heavily technological affair. Gamers are often only lightly insulated from technology. For example, anyone who follows gaming news would likely run into computer terms. Even gamers who do not follow gaming news would run into patches, lag, bugs, or have to know how to connect their consoles to the internet, et cetera. Gaming is unlike television or cable in that video games have a strongly "digital native" feel---especially for P.C. gamers. Gamers discuss video games online on platforms such as Reddit or news sites with forums and comment systems. The culmination of:w

\subsection{Why gamers?}
Gamers and ludology, as discussed earlier, are legitimate areas of study that are largely ignored by academia as well as having an image problem regardless of gaming's prevalance. Gaming as a medium is sometimes strangely maligned as coercing individuals toward violence. In 2019, President Donald Trump as well as Kevin McCarthy and Dan Patrick, both Republican politicians, scapegoated video games as reported by an article in the New York \textit{Times}. The article explains that games are often blamed for shootings despite the lack of causal evidence. The American Psychological Association, according to the \textit{Times}, is that video games and violence are not linked. Dr. Chris Ferguson of the A.P.A. humorously mentioned that the data linking bananas to suicide are about the same as those data connecting video games and other media to violence\cite{drapernyt0819}.


The researchers use an imbalanced and relatively small random sample that skews young and male. The writers justified the skewed sample by reference a two decade old paper despite publishing their article in 2019 and using seemingly recent sources otherwise.

My guiding principle is thus to use my statistical and computing skill coupled with my domain knowledge of video games in order to contribute to ludology. Previous studies on gaming lack domain expertise while exhibiting logical fallacies---both of which seem to be caused by the hermetic world of academia. More proper ludology needs to seed the field
