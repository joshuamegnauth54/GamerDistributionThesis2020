# Josh's master's thesis

The following repository contains my unprocessed LaTeX, my rendered thesis, my scraped data, and my code for my thesis.

My analysis is promising but flawed due to the difficulty of analyzing a large network data set via NetworkX. However, my results show that my thesis isn't completely bunk which in turn means that repeating my study with more data and more computing power would be worthwhile.

I submitted my thesis in December, 2020. Any updates post-2020 are for maintenance.
